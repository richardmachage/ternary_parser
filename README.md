# Ternary Expression Evaluator

This Kotlin-based parser evaluates and executes  ternary operations.  


The primary goal is to parse expressions of the form:  
if (condition, truthy value, falsy value) 


which evaluates to:  

if (condition) {

return truthy value

} else {

return falsy value

}
